MergeRank utilizes the MergeSort algorithm to help users rank a series of items simply by picking their favoirte between two at a time. First, the user types in all the items they wish to rank (favorite movies, favorite albums, favorite games, etc.). Then, the site presents the user with two items at a time. The user proceeds to select which item they prefer until the program full determines the user's ordered list of preference.
